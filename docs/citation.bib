abstract = { A mathematical model is proposed for scheduling activities of periodic type. First a model is proposed for scheduling periodic events with particular time constraints. This problem, which could be considered the extension to periodic phenomena of ordinary scheduling with precedence constraints, is shown to be NP-complete. An algorithm for it of implicit enumeration type is designed based on network flow results, and its average complexity is discussed. Some extensions of the model are considered. The results of this first part serve as a basis in modelling periodic activities using resources. Several cases are considered. Finally some applications are presented for which the proposed model can be a useful tool. }

abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

abstract = {The hope that mathematical methods employed in the investigation of formal logic would lead to purely computational methods for obtaining mathematical theorems goes back to Leibniz and has been revived by Peano around the turn of the century and by Hilbert's school in the 1920's. Hilbert, noting that all of classical mathematics could be formalized within quantification theory, declared that the problem of finding an algorithm for determining whether or not a given formula of quantification theory is valid was the central problem of mathematical logic. And indeed, at one time it seemed as if investigations of this “decision” problem were on the verge of success. However, it was shown by Church and by Turing that such an algorithm can not exist. This result led to considerable pessimism regarding the possibility of using modern digital computers in deciding significant mathematical questions. However, recently there has been a revival of interest in the whole question. Specifically, it has been realized that while no decision procedure exists for quantification theory there are many proof procedures available—that is, uniform procedures which will ultimately locate a proof for any formula of quantification theory which is valid but which will usually involve seeking “forever” in the case of a formula which is not valid—and that some of these proof procedures could well turn out to be feasible for use with modern computing machinery.Hao Wang [9] and P. C. Gilmore [3] have each produced working programs which employ proof procedures in quantification theory. Gilmore's program employs a form of a basic theorem of mathematical logic due to Herbrand, and Wang's makes use of a formulation of quantification theory related to those studied by Gentzen. However, both programs encounter decisive difficulties with any but the simplest formulas of quantification theory, in connection with methods of doing propositional calculus. Wang's program, because of its use of Gentzen-like methods, involves exponentiation on the total number of truth-functional connectives, whereas Gilmore's program, using normal forms, involves exponentiation on the number of clauses present. Both methods are superior in many cases to truth table methods which involve exponentiation on the total number of variables present, and represent important initial contributions, but both run into difficulty with some fairly simple examples.In the present paper, a uniform proof procedure for quantification theory is given which is feasible for use with some rather complicated formulas and which does not ordinarily lead to exponentiation. The superiority of the present procedure over those previously available is indicated in part by the fact that a formula on which Gilmore's routine for the IBM 704 causes the machine to computer for 21 minutes without obtaining a result was worked successfully by hand computation using the present method in 30 minutes. Cf. §6, below.It should be mentioned that, before it can be hoped to employ proof procedures for quantification theory in obtaining proofs of theorems belonging to “genuine” mathematics, finite axiomatizations, which are “short,” must be obtained for various branches of mathematics. This last question will not be pursued further here; cf., however, Davis and Putnam [2], where one solution to this problem is given for ele},

abstract = {Abstract This article addresses the problem of generating conflict-free periodic train timetables for large railway networks. We follow a two-level approach, where a simplified track topology is used to obtain a macrolevel schedule, and the detailed topology is considered locally on the microlevel. To enlarge the solution space in the interface of the two levels, we propose an extension of the well-known periodic event scheduling problem (PESP) such that it allows to generate flexible time slots for the departure and arrival times instead of exact times. This flexible periodic event scheduling problem (FPESP) formulation increases the chance to obtain feasible solutions (exact train routings) subsequently on the microlevel, in particular for stations with dense peak traffic. Total trip time and the time slot sizes are used as multiple objectives and weighted and/or constrained to allocate the flexibility where it is most useful. Tests on medium-size instances of the Swiss Federal Railways' 2007 service intention demonstrate the advantage of the FPESP model, while it only moderately increases its solution time in most cases. A trade-off analysis of the two conflicting objectives is presented and discussed for different scenarios. Finally, we present the Flexbox model, which generalizes the single event flexibilities of the FPESP to arbitrary subsets of events. These Flexboxes can make use of natural dependencies in the timetable and can considerably increase the total flexibility of the timetable. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. NETWORKS, 2011},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new multi-objective periodic railway timetabling (MOPRT) problem with four objectives to be minimized: train journey time, timetable regularity deviation, timetable vulnerability and the number of overtakings. The aim is to find an efficient, regular and robust timetable that utilizes the infrastructure capacity as good as possible. Based on the Periodic Event Scheduling Problem, we formulate the MOPRT problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The ε-constraint method is applied to deal with the multi-objective property, and algorithms are designed to efficiently create the Pareto frontier. By solving the problem for different values of ε, the four-dimensional Pareto frontier is explored to uncover the trade-offs among the four objectives. The optimal solution is obtained from the Pareto-optimal set by using standardized Euclidean distance, while capacity utilization is used as an additional indicator to chose between close solutions. Computational experiments are performed on a theoretical instance and a real instance in one direction of a Dutch railway corridor, demonstrating the efficiency of the model and approach.}
